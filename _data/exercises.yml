    - question: >
        Take another close look at the research data lifecycle. Does the cycle track how you have dealt with your data -- or how you envision doing so?  Do you think these steps actually form a cycle? Are there steps that you hadn’t fully considered?  Do you think there are steps missing?  If you now can see how your research data might have a “lifecycle,” will that change anything about your workflow going forward?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Answers to these questions may vary depending upon how scholars conceive of the research process and how they collect and analyze data.
        One aspect you might question is the arrow from “long-term management” to “discovery and planning”.  Do you see one research project tightly linked to the next in the way this arrow suggests?  One aspect you might not have thought about before is long-term management of your data; had you considered the possibility of (someone) taking care of your data for years or decades?
        A core concern with the RDL model, particularly in the context of qualitative research, is that it has gaps and glosses over details. You can probably think of multiple steps you will take between any two steps in the model.  Also, there is not always a neat distinction between planning, initial, and final data collection. You (will) likely also shift between planning your research (including data collection), carrying it out, and writing. And qualitative researchers often go back and forth between data and theory. The lifecycle doesn’t reflect any of these “back-and-forths”.  When you’re planning your research, you should.

        Using a depiction of the data lifecycle (you can draw one by hand or download and print a PDF version from [here](https://managing-qualitative-data.org/files/data-lifecycle.pdf){:target="_blank"}), write out which data management planning and/or data management steps you should take at every point in the lifecycle.

       The details will of course depend on your individual solution, but the image below gives you some ideas of some DM steps that may occur at each point in the data lifecycle. ![Lifeycle with interventions](https://managing-qualitative-data.org/images/lifecycle-interventions.png){:target="_blank"}
- title: "Using the DMP Tool"
  id: 3
  module: "1b"
  content:
    - question: >
        Create an account for the DMP Tool (if possible through your university) and write a very brief DMP. Your plan does not need to be very detailed (for now) – the goal is to get a sense of the tool.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Go to [https://dmptool.org/](https://dmptool.org/){:target="_blank"}, click on "Get started" and select your institution on the next screen. Then click “Create New DMP” and use a template. We suggest the NSF’s Social, Behavioral, and Economic Science as a good default, but feel free to pick any funder that seems relevant.
- title: "Assessing DMPs"
  id: 4
  module: "1b"
  content:
    - question: >
        Find the rubric by Whitmire et al. [here](https://osf.io/jj7dm/){:target="_blank"} and a scoresheet for the rubric [here](https://osf.io/twynp/){:target="_blank"}. Use this rubric to evaluate the data management plan by Fisher and Nading (2016) [here](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.2.e8720){:target="_blank"}. (Alternatively, when working in a group or with a partner, you can exchange DMPs and assess each other's). For now, use the example language in the rubric to score the DMP.
    - question: >
        As you work through the rubric, try to not just think about what you would improve about the DMP, but also where the rubric itself might fall short.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        You can look at a rubric for the Fisher and Nading data management plan that we filled out [here](https://managing-qualitative-data.org/files/dmp-rubric-fisher-nading.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Don’t expect to have the exact same assessment throughout, but look again at areas where you disagree with our assessment.
    - answer: >
        The most important weakness of the rubric is that it assesses the mere presence of a topic, not the quality of the response. For example, “I will e-mail my data to interested researchers” would qualify as a full score to question 4.2, but is clearly not a satisfactory answer. Moreover, given NSF’s interest in DMPs, they focus heavily on the sharing and dissemination component, but make little mention of some of the earlier, crucial issues, such as back-up or personnel.
- title: "Evaluating Informed Consent Language"
  id: 5
  module: "1c"
  description: Consider these two examples of language from informed consent scripts, identify problems, and suggest improvements.
  content:
    - question: >
        Three people will have direct access to these observations: me, and the two other members of the research team. The written observations will be kept during the analysis of the data, that is, about 3 years. After that, they will be destroyed.
    - question: >
        We will anonymize all data before sharing it in a trusted digital repository. No one will be able to identify you from that data.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        The two biggest issues here are the specification of a restricted group of people with access to the data and the eventual destruction of the data. We would suggest something like this instead:
        “Three people will have direct access to the full observations: me, and the two other members of the research team. We will remove all information that can identify you from these observations before sharing them with other researchers.”
    - answer: >
        As explained above, do not promise that no one will be able to identify participants. Moreover, avoid complex technical terms such as “anonymize” and “trusted digital repository. Instead, something like this may work:
        “We will remove information that can identify you, such as your name and exact date of birth, from the data. Then we will make the data available to other researchers, so that your answers can help scientists better understand why …”

  id: 6
  module: "1c"
  content:
    - question: >
        Now spend some time with writing or editing your own consent script. Reassure your participants that their data is safe, but do not preclude the sharing of data. If working in a group, exchange scripts with a partner.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Read through your consent script (or that of your partner if working in a group) and consider some of the following:
        - Is the language easy to understand for the targe audience?

        - Does the script make clear that the data will be shared?

        - If there is going to be de-identification involved, do you explain what that entails? Do you avoid overpromising?

- title: "Documenting Your Data"
  id: 7
  module: "2a"
  content:
    - question: >
        Make a list of three types of documentation at the project or file level that you will need to create for a research project you are carrying out. For each item, indicate in what form you’ll create the documentation (i.e., as a Word doc, Excel spreadsheet?) and offer a short description of the types of information you’ll include in that documentation.
    - question: >
        Think through three ways in which creating and having this documentation will help you.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Documentation lists and insights will vary considerably from project to project. The goal of this exercise is simply for you to think about the ways in which data documentation is valuable – operationally and analytically – to *you* and *your project*, as the more valuable you perceive documentation to be the more likely you are to create it. We provide a sample solution here, but don’t using it as a template. You should come up with your own strategies matching your data and your workflows.
        

        ### Sample solution
        

        -	Project-level documentation -- “who”

            -	I will use a (continually evolving) Google doc for this (so I can share it with my dissertation advisors easily). I will not use a date-extension in the file name to version, but Google doc’s version history will allow anyone viewing the document to see what changed when.

            -	The document will have two sections: (1\) project personnel and (2\) interview respondents (interviews are the only form of interactive data collection I’m using).

                -	(1\) I will include here a list (using pseudonyms just to be extra cautious) of the small group of people (research assistants, translators, transcribers) whom I’ve invited to work with me on the project, listing information relevant to each (e.g., the institution with which they’re affiliated, how I identified then, when I interviewed and hired them; by what logic, how, how much, and how often I plan to pay them, what exactly they are doing). (I should keep track of their birthdays too.)

                -	(2\) Here I’m thinking not a list of my interview respondents (I have another plan for that) but rather the methodology I used to identify people in their “category” -- i.e., how did I identify/choose judges to interview, how did I identify/choose clerks to interview, how did I identify/choose constitutional scholars to interview, etc..

        -	Project-level documentation -- “when”

            -	I will use a (continually evolving) Google doc for this (so I can share it with my dissertation advisors easily). I will not use a date-extension in the file name to version, but Google doc’s version history will allow anyone viewing the document to see what changed when.

            -	This document is going to be kind of like a diary. Each day I’m going to make a short entry about what I did for my research project. I will be sure to highlight important milestones, key decisions made and problems that I resolved (or am stuck on), key interviews (using a code for respondents), etc..

        -	File-level documentation -- interview

            -	I’m not sure how many of my interviews I’m going to audio-record, and of those, for how many I’ll make formal transcripts. Even without doing these things, though, I will want to keep track of a lot of aspects of my interviews. I already looked ahead to the next lesson and I really like what I saw there about the two types of “informal documentation” I can create for each interview -- both “practical information” and “observations and reactions.

            -	I’m going to have a dedicated Google doc for each interview that contains this information.

            -	Having this information at my fingertips will help me (along with my first type of documentation above) to make sure I’m carrying out my inquiry in a similar way in my second research context.

        -	How this documentation will help me

            -	Having to write all of this will help me think critically about my choices. I didn’t do a very good job *justifying* my choices above, but in my actual documentation I’ll do so. This will help me to make sure I’m making well-founded choices (and convince my dissertation advisors of the same).

            -	Having this will help me remember what I did, which it will be really important to have in mind when I’m interpreting my data and using them to support claims and conclusion in my written work.

            -	I’m carrying out my project in two different countries and I want my research processes to be the same in both (in hopes of maximizing the comparability of my data). Keeping careful track of all of this will help me to operate the same way in both contexts.

                -	For instance, it will be really important that I try to identify people in the same way -- and have more or less the same mix of people -- in both of my interview contexts. My first and third types of documentation above will help me to do that.

- title: "Creating Templates"
  id: 8
  module: "2b"
  content:
    - question: >
         Amend the template archive log we offered above in a way that will make it more useful for your project, or create a template for “informal documentation” for a form of interactive data collection in which you are engaging or will engage. Make sure to think hard about what information particular to your project you want to systematically collect. Then choose one of the options below:

          -    If you are working independently, consider whether, realistically, you will use your template – is it so complicated that you are unlikely to stick with it? Also, imagine yourself six to nine months in the future trying to remember the data-collection context. What is your template missing that would help you re-conjure that context?

          -    If you are taking this course at the same time as someone else whom you know, exchange templates, and critique each other’s. What do you find particularly valuable / useful about your partner’s template? What is missing? What is extraneous?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        There is no “solution” to this exercise. As you look at your (or your partner’s) templates, consider the following: (1) will it be easy to use during your research? (2) will you be able to find relevant information quickly and easily? (3) will the information in your template help someone else to understand your data? (4) what other criteria are important?


        ### Sample solution
        
        -   I will use a Google Sheet for this instead of an Excel spreadsheet so I can easily show it to my dissertation advisors. I plan to add three columns to the template.
          -    In the particular archive in which I’m working different rooms (which include different types of materials) have different names -- so I’m going to add a column for “room name”.
          -    Another observation I had is that some collections are far more organized than others. I need to think about why, but I will add a column for “degree of collection organization” so I can keep track of this.
          -    OK, this is a bit weird, but I’ve noticed that records from April-May 1997 seem to be missing from a lot of the collections -- but not from all of them. Again, I don’t know why, but this has attracted my attention. So I’m going to add a column for “April-May 1997 missing from collection?” so I can keep track of this.
          -    While I’ve now made my template a bit more complicated, I’m still confident that I’ll use it (I’m a complicated person). Right now I also can’t
- title: "Comparing Documentation / Metadata"
  id: 9
  module: "2b"
  content:
    - question: >
         Compare [these data on figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.2008653.v1){:target="_blank"} with [these data on QDR](https://doi.org/10.5064/F6CN723S){:target="_blank"}. What are some of the differences in terms of the quantity and the quality of documentation? Which data do you feel like you have a better feel for -- and will be better able to interpret -- even before looking at the data? What is it about the metadata and documentation that helps you most?

  solution:
    - answer: >
        You likely noticed that the QDR project includes more detailed information about the content and generation of the data *and* more detailed metadata. Here are some ways that the more detailed documentation attending the QDR project can help you better understand (and more easily use) the data:
          -   You can tell when the data were collected and where.

          -    You can follow the logic of the social media excerpts Clarke has collected. On the other hand, can you follow the meaning of the “Subject” codes in the first column of the Patel et al. data?

          -    You can better decide on whether and how much to trust the data.
- title: "Folder and Filename Assessment"
  id: 10
  module: "2c"
  content:
    - question: >
        Open the master folder for one of your current research projects and  candidly assess how clearly and consistently you are naming your  folders and files. Consider, for instance, the following:

        -   How many levels of folders do you have -- levels within levels within levels? Are there enough levels, too many, or too few?

        -   Can you tell, without opening a folder, what is in it?

        -   Is there some logic behind the organization of your folders, or does it seem you just created a new one whenever you needed one?

        -   How consistent are the names of your files?

        -   If you have multiple versions of particular files, can you tell which is the most current?

    - question: >
        Create a new document (clearly named!) that will be a draft of the  memo to yourself about the organization and naming of your folders  and files. Create the first few bullets under “folder organization  and naming” and under “file organization and naming” that could  serve as instructions to yourself for (re)organizing and  (re)naming your folders and files.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        As with many other exercises, this one has no standard solution.  The goal is simply for you to begin thinking critically about how  you are organizing and naming your folders and files, and to take  the first steps toward more optimal organization and naming. If  you find that there are some real improvements to make, think  about when you will make them, cognizant that changes are much  easier to make the earlier you are in your project.

    - question: >
         Take QDR’s [Data Safety & Security Self-assessment here](https://managing-qualitative-data.org/files/safety-security-self-assessment.pdf){:target="_blank"} and see if and where your current practices need improvement. If there are things you want to change, make at least one such change immediately.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Again, this exercise has no standard solution. Its goal is to highlight the importance of being mindful of data security from the very beginning of a research project. This relatively small investment will give you peace of mind throughout your research process. Don’t skip it.
- title: "Digitizing Documents (optional)"
  id: 12
  module: "2d"
  content:
    - question: >
        If your work is heavily based on documentary evidence and you anticipate taking a lot of digital pictures of documents, and you are not familiar with the steps above, carry them out for a set of five documents:
          -   Take a digital picture of each.
          -   Assemble them into a single PDF.
          -   Familiarize yourself with two OCR tools by using them to turn a scanned image file into machine-readable text.
          -   If the steps in either process were unintuitive or easily forgotten, make yourself a quick “cheat sheet” outlining the steps so you are not starting from square one the next time.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Rather than a solution, we offer some questions for you to think about. What did you learn about the software you used? What did you name your “cheat sheet” – is that a good name? Where did you put it and why? Will you be able to find it again?
- title: "Transcribing Interviews (optional)"
  id: 13
  module: "2d"
  content:
    - question: >
        Transcribe ten minutes of the audio recording from an interview, focus group, or other type of interactive data collection in which you engaged. (Alternatively, you can find on YouTube an audio recording -- in the language that you use to collect / generate data -- of an interview conducted by someone else relating to the topic of you research.) Play the recording and manually write down what each person says during the first ten minutes of the exchange. Record your observations / reactions:
          -   How long did it take you?
          -   What were the biggest challenges?
          -   What formatting issues immediately occur to you and how would you resolve them?
          -   If you were to use software to help you transcribe, what functionality do you now know it needs to have?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        This exercise is designed to give you a sense of the transcription process; to help you decide whether transcribing the recordings from your interactive data collection is something you want to do; and to help direct your technology choices. Think carefully about your answers to the questions, reminding yourself of approximately how many recordings you anticipate you will be dealing with.
- title: "Translating Sources (optional)"
  id: 14
  module: "2d"
  content:
    - question: >
         If you have transcripts in a language different from the one in which you will write your research products, translate a brief tranche of one transcript into the language in which you will write your research product. (If you have not yet created transcripts, translate a small tranche of, say, an article related to your research topic that is in the language in which you plan to conduct your interactive data collection.) Record your observations / reactions:
          -   How long did it take you?
          -   What were the biggest challenges?
          -   If you were to use software to help you translate, what functionality do you now see it will need to have?
  solution:
    - answer: >
       This exercise is designed to give you a sense of the translation process; to help you decide whether translating the transcripts of the recordings of your interactive data collection is something you would like to do; and to help direct your technology choices. Think carefully about your answers to the questions, reminding yourself of approximately how many transcripts, and how much of those transcripts you might need to translate.
- title: "Creating a Data Sharing Policy"
  id: 15
  module: "3a"
  content:
    - question: >
        Two of the institutional actors that have been carefully considering all of the questions above are funders and publishers. They need to take on these issues because they must develop policies for applicants and grantees, and authors, to follow. Given the considerations, benefits, and challenges above, how should key institutional actors design policies to encourage responsible data sharing? Pretend you are the editor-in-chief of a journal of your choice. Develop a draft policy that you will translate into author guidelines for providing the qualitative data that underpin articles published in your journal, and accompanying “materials” (e.g., documentation). Your policy should address the following issues:
        -   Which data should be shared and what in addition to data needs to be shared (“materials”)?
        -   When in the publication process should data (and materials) be shared?
        -   Where should data (and materials) be shared?
        -   What established exceptions should there be?
        -   Who should judge whether a scholar’s situation fits within those exceptions – or, if it does not, whether an exception should nonetheless be made?
        -   How will the policy be enforced?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        There are no right or wrong answers to these questions! We encourage you to evaluate your answers along the following lines:
        -   Is your policy coherent – do its different aspects fit together without contradicting each other?
        -   How easy will it be to translate your policy into clear guidelines for authors?
        -   What kind of behavior are the different aspects of your policy, and your policy as a whole, encouraging on the part of authors and reviewers?
        -   Of the various involved actors (authors, reviewers, other institutions), whom have you empowered – granted decision-making authority?
        -   Have you addressed possible trade-offs between promoting data sharing and deterring authors from submitting their best work to your journal?
        -   What potential sources of conflict does your policy introduce?

        To illustrate the state of current practices, here are two different data policies. The *PLOS* journals [data policy](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability){:target="_blank"} mandates data deposit for all articles, explicitly states that proprietary data are not acceptable as the sole empirical basis for an article, and describes specific options for qualitative data. The [*American Political Science Review*’s data policy](https://www.apsanet.org/APSR-Submission-Guidelines){:target="_blank"} (see “Reproduction Policy”) is significantly shorter with fewer requirements. As you consider these policies, note some of the differences between what is required for scholarship based on quantitative data and analysis v. work based on qualitative data and analysis.

        Read the passage in [this PDF](https://managing-qualitative-data.org/files/de-identification-exercise.pdf){:target="_blank"} and then seek to de-identify it as best you can. Your first step should be to create a set of de-identification rules to follow.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        You can find a [sample de-identification here]({{site.baseurl}}/files/de-identification-exercise-solution.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Note how we left some specific information such as “Philadelphia” and “South Philadelphia” intact, while replacing other specific information such as years and school names. Details of de-identification depend both on what additional context is provided in the interview transcript and what parts are of particular importance to a study, i.e., should not be removed if at all possible.

        You’re planning to visit a historical archive, and while you have looked on line in an effort to discover their rules about the further dissemination of their materials, you have not been able to find them. Compose an email to the archivist requesting permission to include the materials you will obtain from the archive in a data project you plan to share.

        Here are some things your request might have included:
        -   your institutional affiliation;
        -   the nature of your research project;
        -   why the data are important for your project;
        -   why you would like to share the data;

        QDR has [a template for such an email](https://qdr.syr.edu/guidance/templates#archival-reuse){:target="_blank"} that you might send after conducting your research if you did not find this information out during your time at the archive. If you can, though, it is better to ask these sorts of questions before or during your research at the archive.

        The list of broken links that Gertler and Bullock note (in their 2017 article in *PS*) that they found in the *American Political Science Review* (see above-cited article) is part of the data accompanying their *PS* article; they shared the data through Harvard Dataverse [here](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/Q8VDN0){:target="_blank"} in the file “brokenReproducibilityURLs.tab”. Download the file, open it in Excel, and find the first five links marked as “Did not find resource”. What sorts of websites are these? Can you still find the linked content using the Internet Archive’s [Way Back Machine](https://archive.org/web/){:target="_blank"}?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        You’ll have noted that the broken links lead to all sorts of different websites: personal, institutional, even government websites. In some cases (such as Erik Voeten’s Princeton page and the Polish Center for Public Opinion Research CBOS), the Way Back Machine is not able to find any archived copy. You may still be able to track down this information by looking at the current sites for such individuals and institutions – or you may not. In other cases, you can access the webpage, such as Richard Tucker’s page at Vanderbilt, but the actual data aren’t archived there. For the Correlates of War project, you are able to download the full data from the Internet Archive. You could also go to the project’s [current site](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/folder_listing){:target="_blank"}, but would you be able to find the version of the data mentioned in the 2000 *APSR* article there? The internet offers you powerful tools to retrieve old information, but even with those tools, the content behind some links – containing key parts of the scholarly record – may be lost forever. You should have strategies for tracking down such lost data, but more importantly, you should make sure that the same fate does not befall your data and links. The best way to do this is to deposit your data in a repository.

        Watch the short video above and write down the various types of problems created by the ad hoc sharing arrangement for which the bear on the left opted. How would these problems have been mitigated if the bear had deposited his data in a data repository? While the bears are discussing quantitative data, would the challenges be the same for qualitative data?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Some of the problems created by the left bear’s ad hoc sharing arrangement include: (1) lots of inter-researcher communication which is inefficient; (2) the passage of a long period of time before the data are actually shared, in part because the left bear cannot locate them; (3) the format of the data is obsolete which temporarily prevents their use; (4) the data cannot be interpreted by the secondary user (Dr. Benign, the panda); (5) the original researcher-bear, not having documented the data, does not remember how to interpret the data and his co-author, who may remember, cannot be located. Had the left bear deposited his data (and complete documentation) in a data repository, they would have been more quickly accessible to, and more easily interpreted by Dr. Benign; for instance, curation would have entailed updating the format. Dr. Benign would likely face similar challenges if the data were qualitative.

        Find the web site of the repository at your institution and poke around a bit. (If your institution doesn’t seem to have an institutional repository, try to find the institutional repository at another institution that is similar to yours or with which you’re familiar.) Then find the web site of another kind of repository (choosing from one of the categories above) and poke around a bit. What similarities and differences do you notice? You might think about these first with regard to the *content* of the venue, then from the perspective of someone who might wish to *deposit* data in the venue, then from the perspective of someone who might with to *access* data from the venue.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Your answers might concern (1) cost of accessing data or depositing data; (2) focus (on research publications vs. research data); (3) how much published guidance the repository provides for depositors; (4) whether, and what level of, curation services the data repository provides; (5) what metadata are available for data in the repository and how revealing they are. If you tried to access data, your answers might consider (6) whether you had to become a registered user before seeing any data and (7) how easy it seems to be to find data in the repository and to deposit data.

        Take two pages of something you are currently writing based on qualitative data and analysis (or something you wrote in the recent past), and consider how easy it would be for you to quickly identify and get your hands on the sources needed to support a few of your claims.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        This exercise is calling on you to assess how well you know your data – how “accessible” they are to you. If you weren’t able to turn immediately to a list of your data, or the appropriate folder on your computer, but instead started ransacking different folders of your computer thinking about what might serve as evidence, you may not know your data as well as you should. Consider making a data-source manifest to rectify this problem.

        Find this article on-line and then follow the steps below: O’Mahoney, Joseph. 2017. “Making the Real: Rhetorical Adduction and the Bangladesh Liberation War.” *International Organization* 71 (2): 317–48. [https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818317000054](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818317000054){:target="_blank"}
        
        1. Click on the Adobe Acrobat icon to download the PDF.
        2. Read the abstract.
        3. Scroll to a section called, “The Role of Troop Withdrawal” on p. 332 and read the first two paragraphs of that section.
        4. Given what you have learned about ATI, which passages of those paragraphs would you expect to see annotated and with what type of content? Use your PDF viewer’s annotations functionality to highlight them.
        5. Now view the same article [with ATI annotations here](https://hyp.is/go?url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/D7396F6DFDE0914CD3C1C8D7A7141BF9/S0020818317000054a.pdf/making_the_real_rhetorical_adduction_and_the_bangladesh_liberation_war.pdf&group=zvEVDE2R){:target="_blank"}. Find the same two paragraphs and compare your expected annotations with those of the article’s author, Joey O’Mahoney.
          1. How do the author’s annotations differ from your expectations?
          2. Why do you think they differ?
          3. How do the annotations affect your assessment of the underlying claims?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        It is unlikely that your expectations and the author’s annotations matched exactly. This reflects a challenge in achieving qualitative transparency -- there is an almost unlimited number of things about which you can add information and be more transparent in order to better convince readers of your claims. One way to “triage” is to develop explicit rules for yourself about the types of passages or claims you annotate. You can see [*O’Mahoney’s discussion of his “logic of annotation” here*](https://doi.org/10.5064/F6M2H9VQ){:target="_blank"}. Perhaps you also found that the annotations raised as many questions as they answered, e.g., why did the author annotate *this* claim but not *that* one? Making your work more vulnerable to criticism by exposing more of its internal workings is a very real risk of working more transparently. Yet it is precisely this susceptibility, which facilitates correction and learning, that allows social science to advance.

    - question: >
        Using a research product you recently completed, choose three contiguous pages that contain multiple evidence-based claims. Do you feel that you were able to substantiate all of those claims as well as you wished? Some of them? Few of them? If your answer is “some” or “few,” was part of the challenge space-limitations? If so, try to remember additional information or evidence that you cut as you were revising the piece, and use that information to annotate a few passages in the piece, following the description above and the [directions here](https://qdr.syr.edu/ati/ati-instructions){:target="_blank"}. Consider what was easy and hard about that process. Ask yourself what you are gaining – and what you may be losing – through annotation.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        1.  One thing you might have found easy about engaging in ATI is writing your annotations; since they are free-standing you may be able to write them quickly as you don’t need to worry about blending them perfectly into the text.

        2.  One thing you might have found difficult about using ATI is finding the materials on which you wanted to call for evidence. (We hope if you try this in the future, following some of the advice we offer elsewhere in the course will facilitate this.)

        3.  One thing you might be gaining through annotation is the possibility of demonstrating even more strongly the rigor and power of your work through deploying additional evidence.
  
        4.  Two things you might be losing through annotation are time and parsimony. It might not seem that the “bang” of “retrospective” annotation is not worth the “buck”. You might feel differently if you annotated while writing. With regard to parsimony, how much did what you added contribute to supporting the claim you sought to bolster? Is it a nice-to-have or a need-to-have? What should your annotations contain?

    - question: >
        Look at Erik Bleich’s article “[Historical Institutionalism and Judicial Decision-Making: Ideas, Institutions, and Actors in French High Court Hate Speech Rulings](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0043887117000272){:target="_blank"}” and its accompanying [Interview Methods Appendix](https://static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:article:S0043887117000272/resource/name/S0043887117000272sup001.pdf){:target="_blank"} (scroll to Appendix B). Also, open the [data for the article on QDR](https://doi.org/10.5064/F6833Q5K){:target="_blank"}. Quickly skim the article, and read more closely through the narrative for 1993 to 1997 starting on page 70, focusing in particular on claims made based on interview evidence. Look up the notes for the cited interviews available on QDR. What does the availability of the interview methods appendix add? Do the interview notes help you better evaluate the quality of the inference that is based on interviews?

  solution:
    - answer: >
        Your reactions to the interview methods appendix will be shaped by your epistemological priors, i.e., how much you think it is possible to learn through human participants research. If you believe we gain significant insights from such research, at first blush having more information about the interviews that Bleich conducted, and more of the raw data available to you, are likely to make you more persuaded by the argument. Beyond that, your evaluations will depend upon whether you wanted more or different kinds of information about the interviews, and whether the additional information Bleich provided about his cited interviews made you *more* confident in them, or potentially less confident. If you had both reactions, why was that the case?

        Draft the framework for a data appendix for a research product you are currently creating. What set of attributes would work across all of your different forms of data (documents, interviews transcripts / notes, etc.) and help your readers understand and evaluate your project’s evidentiary foundation?

  solution:
    - answer: >
        [This Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PjHpMbi6ylyudRen9Iq1yLCCMTT54rjMaK5GyHZlif8/edit#gid=780311438) offers the beginnings of a framework for a data appendix for an article examining “Institutions of Electoral Governance”. It includes four tabs, one for each type of data (evidence) on which the article draws. Each tab includes columns for a series of attributes that should help readers to quickly understand the evidentiary base of the article, assess its quality, and thus evaluate how well claims based on these data sources are supported.

    - question: >
        Find two recent research articles in your field that rely on publicly available data (either shared by the authors themselves or by others). Do they include data availability statements? Are the data cited in the bibliography? If the answer to either of the questions is no, how would a data availability statement/bibliography entry have looked?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        The purpose of the first part of this exercise is to get you used to the idea of looking for data availability statements as part of your standard research practices. Where data are available, take a look – you can learn a lot from studying other researchers’ data. Where data are not available, ask yourself why not. For the citation and the data availability statement, check whether your solution has the key elements identified above.
