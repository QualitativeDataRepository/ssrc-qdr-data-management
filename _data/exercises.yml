- title: "Your Research and the Data Lifecycle"
  id: 1
  module: "1a"
  #description: "This is a test exercise"
  content:
    - question: >
        Consider why the use of research data is depicted as a “cycle”. In particular, what does the dashed arrow from “Long-term Management” to “Discovery and Planning” represent?
    - question: >
        Which activities that are part of *your* research fall under the different headings of the lifecycle?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        The basic idea for the cyclical nature of research data is its re-use. Often, you may be re-using your own data. Something you found in your original data peaked your interest and becomes the basis for your next project. In other cases, other researchers may take advantage of data you shared and use them as the basis for  their next project
    - answer: >
        This will depend on your research but here are some possible activities in each category
      subanswers:
        - subanswer: >
            *Discovery and Planning:* design research; review literature, identify existing data; apply for funding; hire research team; plan data security and backups; plan informed consent. apply for IRB.
        - subanswer: >
            *Initial Data Collection:* identifying participants / interviewees / archives, etc. collect data; document data; store and back-up data; identify additional data needed.
        - subanswer: >
            *Final Data Preparation and Analysis:* collect additional data; convert data for analysis (OCR, transcription, etc.); read, annotate, analyze using software.
        - subanswer: >
            *Publication and Sharing*: write! Finalized documentation; de-identify data if needed; deposit with data with repository, publicize through social media, e-mail, etc.
        - subanswer: >
            *Long-term Management*: Handled by data repository.
- title: "Limitations of the Lifecycle Model"
  id: 2
  module: "1a"
#  description: "This is a test exercise with NO subanswers"
  content:
    - question: >
        What are some of the limitations of how well the data lifecycle model represents actual research, especially as you think about qualitative research?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Like every model, the data lifecycle glosses over details. For example, there often won’t be a neat distinction between planning, initial, and final data collection. You may also find that you go back between research and writing/publication. For example, scholars would frequently conduct additional research between dissertation  and the book resulting from the dissertation. Arguabl y many of this applies particularly strongly to qua litative  research. In many qualitative traditions, researchers  go back and forth between data and theory. The lifecycl e  paints to neat a picture of that. As you use it as a  planning device, make sure to account for such “back-and  forth.”
- title: "Using the Data Lifeycle for Planning"
  id: 3
  module: "1b"
#  description: "This is a test exercise with SUBSUBANSWERS"
  content:
    - question: >
        Using a depiction of the data lifecycle (you can draw one per hand or download and print a PDF version from [here](https://qualitativedatarepository.github.io/ssrc-qdr-data-management/files/data-lifecycle.pdf)), mark at every point in the lifecycle which data management and/or data management planning steps you should take. Remember you already did some related work in an exercise in the last lesson.
  solution:
    - answer: >
       The details will of course depend on your individual solution, but the image below gives you some ideas of which steps may occur at which point in the data lifecycle. ![Lifeycle with interventions](https://qualitativedatarepository.github.io/ssrc-qdr-data-management/images/lifecycle-interventions.png)
- title: "Using the DMP Tool"
  id: 4
  module: "1c"
#  description: "This is a test exercise with SUBSUBANSWERS"
  content:
    - question: >
        Create an account for the DMP Tool (if possible through your university) and write a very brief data management plan. You plan does not need to be very detailed (for now) – the goal is to get a sense of the tool.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Go to [https://dmptool.org/](https://dmptool.org/), click on "Get started" and select your institution on the next screen. Then click “Create New DMP” and use a template. We suggest the NSF’s Social, Behavioral, and Economic Science as a good default, but feel free to pick any funder that seems relevant.
- title: "Assessing DMPs"
  id: 5
  module: "1c"
#  description: "This is a test exercise with SUBSUBANSWERS"
  content:
    - question: >
        Find the rubric by Whitmire et al. [here](https://osf.io/jj7dm/) and a scoresheet for the rubric [here](https://osf.io/twynp/). Use this rubric to evaluate the data management plan by Fisher and Nading (2016) [here](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.2.e8720). Alternatively, when working in a group or with a partner, you can exchange DMPs and assess each other.
    - question: >
        As you work through the rubric, try to not just think about what you would improve about the data management plan, but also where the rubric itself might fall short.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        You can look at a rubric for the Fisher and Nading data management plan that we filled out here. Don’t expect to have the exact same assessment throughout, but look again at areas where you disagree with our assessment.
    - answer: >
        The most important weakness of the rubric is that it assesses the mere presence of a topic, not the quality of the response. For example, “I will e-mail my data to interested researchers” would qualify as a full score to question 4.2, but is clearly not a satisfactory answer. Moreover, given NSF’s interest in DMPs, they focus heavily on the sharing and dissemination component, but make little mention of some of the earlier, crucial issues, such as back-up or personnel.
- title: "Evaluating Informed Consent Language"
  id: 6
  module: "1d"
  description: Consider these two examples of language from informed consent scripts, identify problems, and suggest improvements.
  content:
    - question: >
        Three people will have direct access to these observations: me, and the two other members of the research team. The written observations will be kept during the analysis of the data, that is, about 3 years. After that, they will be destroyed.
    - question: >
        We will anonymize all data before sharing it in a trusted digital repository. No one will be able to identify you from that data.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        The two biggest issues here are the specification of a restricted group of people with access to the data and the eventual destruction of the data. We would suggest something like this instead:
        “Three people will have direct access to the full observations: me, and the two other members of the research team. We will remove all information that can identify you from these observations before sharing them with other researchers.”
    - answer: >
        As explained above, do not promise that no one will be able to identify participants. Moreover, avoid complex technical terms such as “anonymize” and “trusted digital repository. Instead, something like this may work:
        “We will remove information that can identify you, such as your name and exact date of birth, from the data. Then we will make the data available to other researchers, so that your answers can help scientists better understand why …”
- title: "Craft Your Own Consent Language"
  id: 7
  module: "1d"
  content:
    - question: >
        Now spend some time with writing or editing your own consent script. Reassure your participants that their data is safe, but do not preclude the sharing of data. If working in a group, exchange scripts with a partner.
  solution:
    - answer: >
- title: "Creating a Data Sharing Policy"
  id: 8
  module: "3a"
  content:
    - question: >
        Two of the institutional actors that have been carefully considering all of the questions above are funders and publishers. They need to take on these issues because they must develop policies for applicants and grantees, and authors, to follow. Given the considerations, benefits, and challenges above,
        how should key institutional actors design policies to encourage responsible data sharing? Pretend you are the editor-in-chief of a
        journal of your choice. Develop a draft policy that you will translate into author guidelines for providing the qualitative data that underpin articles published in your journal. Your policy should address the following issues:
          -   Which data should be shared and what in addition to data needs
              to be shared?
          -   When in the publication process should data (and materials) be
              shared?
          -   Where should data (and materials) be shared?
          -   What established exceptions should there be?
          -   Who should judge whether a scholar’s situation fits within those
              exceptions – or whether the alternative situation for which a
              scholar seeks an exception should be deemed exceptional?
          -   How will the policy be enforced?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        There are no right or wrong answers to these questions! We encourage you to evaluate your answers along the following lines: Are your answers coherent – do they fit together without contradicting each other? How easy will they be to translate into clear guidelines for authors? What kind of behavior are the different aspects of your policy, and your policy as a whole, encouraging on the part of authors and reviewers? Of the various involved actors (authors, reviewers, other institutions), whom have you empowered – granted decision-making authority? Have you addressed possible trade-offs between promoting data sharing and deterring authors from submitting their best work to your journal? What potential sources of conflict does your policy introduce?
- title: "De-identification"
  id: 9
  module: "3b"
  content:
    - question: >
        Read the passage in [this PDF](https://qualitativedatarepository.github.io/ssrc-qdr-data-management/files/De-identification-exercise.pdf) and then seek to de-identify it as best you can. Begin to create a set of de-identification rules to follow.
  solution:
    - answer: >
        You can find a [sample de-identification here](https://qualitativedatarepository.github.io/ssrc-qdr-data-management/files/De-identification-exercise-solution.pdf). Note how we left some information such as "Philadelphia" and "South Philadelphia" intact, while widening more specif information such as years and school names. Details of de-identification depend both on what additional context is provided in the interview and what parts are of particular importance to a study, i.e. should not be removed if at all possible.
- title: "Public Domain or Not?"
  id: 10
  module: "3c"
  content:
    - question: >
         Determine whether the following works are under copyright or in the public domain, and justify your determination:
           1. [This image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/United_States_President_Barack_Obama_bends_down_to_allow_the_son_of_a_White_House_staff_member_to_touch_his_head.jpg/1920px-United_States_President_Barack_Obama_bends_down_to_allow_the_son_of_a_White_House_staff_member_to_touch_his_head.jpg) of Obama and the son of one of his staffers taken by Pete Souza, official White House photographer, in 2009

  solution:
    - answer: >
           1. Yes (was produced by an employee of the US government in the exercise of their duty)
           
           2. No (was not produced by an employee of the US government)
           
           3. Yes (published before 1923)
           
           4. No (work by Canadian government employees is protected by copyright for 50 years under “Crown copyright.” We did not necessarily expect you to delve into Canadian law here, but hope the provenance of the image made you realize that that is the source that you’d have to check to answer the question, and brought home the point that you should assume a work *is* under copyright unless you *know* otherwise.)
- title: "Getting Permission from an Archive"
  id: 11
  module: "3c"
  content:
    - question: >
        You’re planning to visit a historical archive that has posted online some rules about the further dissemination of their materials that you don’t really understand. Compose an email to the archivist requesting permission to include the materials you will obtain from the archive in a data project you plan to share.

  solution:
    - answer: >
        Here are some things your request might have included: your institutional affiliation; the nature of your research project; why the data are important for your project; why you would like to share the data; in what specific data repository you plan to share the data and what that implies for their accessibility; when you would like to share the data; when you will be visiting the archive; an offer to discuss the matter with the archivist when you are on sight.
- title: "Link Rot"
  id: 12
  module: "3d"
  content:
    - question: >
        The list of the broken links that Gertler and Bullock found in the *American Political Science Review* (see above-cited article) is part of the data accompanying the article that they shared through Harvard Dataverse [here](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/Q8VDN0) in the file “brokenReproducibilityURLs.tab”. Download the file, open it in Excel, and find the first five links marked as “Did not find resource”. What sorts of websites are these? Can you still find the linked content using the Internet Archive’s [Way Back Machine](https://archive.org/web/)?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        You’ll have noted that the broken links lead to all sorts of different websites: personal, institutional, even government websites. In some cases (such as Erik Voeten’s Princeton page and the Polish Center for Public Opinion Research CBOS), the Way Back Machine is not able to find any archived copy. You may still be able to track down this information by looking at the current sites -- or you may not. For other cases, you can access the webpage, such as Richard Tucker’s page at Vanderbilt, but the actual data aren’t archived there. For the Correlates of War project, you are able to download the full data from the Internet Archive. You could also go to the project’s [current site](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/folder_listing), but would you be able to find the version of the data corresponding to the 2000 article there? 
        
        The internet offers you powerful tools to retrieve old information, but even with those tools, the content behind some links -- containing key parts of the scholarly record -- may be lost forever. You should have strategies for tracking down such lost data, but more importantly, you should make sure that the same fate does not befall your data and links. The best way to do this is to deposit your data in a repository.
- title: "Data Sharing SNAFU"
  id: 13
  module: "3d"
  content:
    - question: >
        Watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66oNv_DJuPc) and write down the various types of problems created by the ad hoc sharing arrangement for which the bear on the left opted. How would these problems have been mitigated if the bear had deposited his data in a data repository? While the bears are discussing quantitative data, would the challenges be the same for qualitative data?
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Some of the problems created by the left bear’s ad hoc sharing arrangement include:  (1) lots of inter-researcher communication which is inefficient; (2) the passage of a long period of time before the data are actually shared; (3) the format of the data is obsolete which temporarily prevents their use; (4) the data cannot be interpreted by the secondary user; (5) the original researcher, not having documented the data, does not remember how to interpret the data and his co-author, who may remember, cannot be located. Had the left bear deposited his data (and complete documentation) in a data repository, they would have been more quickly accessible to, and more easily interpreted by Dr. Benign (the panda); for instance, curation would have entailed updating the format.  Dr. Benign would likely face similar challenges if the data were qualitative.
- title: "Getting to Know Your Repository"
  id: 14
  module: "3d"
  content:
    - question: >
        Find the web site of the repository at your institution and poke around a bit. (If your institution doesn’t seem to have an institutional repository, try to find the institutional repository at another institution that is similar to yours or with which you’re familiar.) Then find the web site of another kind of repository (choosing from one of the categories above) and poke around a bit. What similarities and differences do you notice? 
  solution:
    - answer: >
        Your answers might concern (1) cost of accessing data or depositing data; (2) focus (on research publications vs. research data); (3) how much published guidance the repository provides for depositors; (4) whether, and what level of, curation services the data repository provides. If you tried to access data, your answers might consider (5) whether you had to become a registered user before seeing any data and)(6) how easy it seems to be to find data in the repository and to deposit data.
