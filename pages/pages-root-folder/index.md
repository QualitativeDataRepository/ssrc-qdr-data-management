Data are valuable, and form the basis for your empirical claims. Better data management means better research, can help you address concerns about your data that reviewers of your research might raise, and makes your data more easily shareable.'

# Use the call for action to show a button on the frontpage
# 
# To make internal links, just use a permalink like this
# url: /getting-started/
