As you deploy data -- including your own data! -- as evidence in your research products, you should cite them as you would cite any other resources to which you refer. By using formal citations (as opposed to just linking to or mentioning the data you use), you make sure that readers can find the data you reference; correct and complete citation, then, is a key aspect of research transparency. In addition, proper data citation allows the scholar who collected or generated the data to get appropriate credit. Citing research data also serves as an acknowledgment that data are a product of value themselves, distinct from publications that draw on them.

## Components of a Data Citation

Like any other citation, data citations contain author(s), a year of publication, a title, a publisher (the repository in which the data reside, for instance), and possibly a version number. Most data repositories will also assign a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to data, which always begins with 10. Preceded by “[https://doi.org/](https://doi.org/)” the DOI provides a permanent link to the data.

Where it exists, *the DOI should always be part of the citation*. These DOIs are part of a broader system that provides metasearch functionality for repositories that issue DOIs. For instance, you can search across all datasets that have a DOI on
[search.datacite.org](https://search.datacite.org/). The DOI system makes it a lot easier for scholars who generate data to get credit when others cite and reuse their data, and a lot easier for scholars to find data relevant to their work.

For instance, each time a dataset with a DOI is cited in a journal article (which also has a DOI), the organization registering the journal article DOI ([Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/)) catalogs the event, establishing an automated citation count.

Many data repositories include recommended citations for data:

![Recommended data citation from QDR]({{site.baseurl}}/images/recommended-data-citation.png)

You can use that citation or adapt it to your citation style of choice. Increasingly, reference managers such as Zotero and Endnote will let you import citation data from data repositories and produce correctly formatted citations.

## Citing Your Own Data

When citing your own data, you will typically include references in two locations. First, the citation will appear in a “data availability statement,” which is placed on the article’s abstract page on the journal web site or in the first footnote.

![Data availability statement]({{site.baseurl}}/images/data-availability-statement.png)

Second, the data should *also* be cited formally in the bibliography of the article. While data availability statements are fairly standard in published papers, including the data in the bibliography is not. Doing so is important, however, as it helps your article and data to stay linked together. We strongly encourage this practice.

In both cases, remember to include the DOI.

### Citing Other Researchers’ Data

When you use other researchers’ data in your written work, cite them as you would with any other scholarly contribution on which you draw. If the data are available from a data repository, always refer to the repository copy in your citation: repositories are set up to ensure that the data will still be available, and findable using the citation information they provide, many years ahead.

Some large data projects, such as the [World Value Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp) self-archive, meaning the project holds and disseminates the data rather than publishing them through a data repository. In almost all cases, they will recommend a citation format, which you should follow, taking particular care to cite the exact version of the data you have used in your work.

### Beyond Citation

Citing data gives credit to researchers who collect and share data. Doing so also enhances the findability of data, thus making your work more transparent. In some instances, additional steps beyond citing data may be warranted. For instance, if your work draws on (and cites) a large-scale data project and you only use a subset of the data produced by the project, you should describe how and why you extracted the particular subsets of the data that you used in your study.

Depending upon how central to your scholarship the data you re-used were, you might even consider offering the scholar who generated them co-authorship on your publication. This practice is currently more prevalent in the natural sciences, but may be worth considering in the social sciences as disciplines begin to place greater value on data generation. An interesting alternative that has appeared in the medical field is to list “data authors” [(Bierer, Crosas, and Pierce 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc1707245) on publications – signaling that those scholars contributed to data generation but did not collaborate on the publication (and don’t necessarily concur with its conclusions).

Either of these alternatives raises the profile of data and those who create them, emphasizing the contributions they make to knowledge generation.
