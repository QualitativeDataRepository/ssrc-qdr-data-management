## What is a data management plan?

So far we have talked about data management and the importance of
planning. A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document that specifies your
plans for data management for the whole duration of the project. The
plan summarizes the various decisions you took while planning your data
management. Broadly, the plan should cover the following topics:

1.  The types of data you expect to collect,
2.  How those data will be documented and organized,
3.  How the data will be stored and kept secure, and
4.  How the data will be shared (or why not) and stored for the
    long term.

We provide more detailed instructions below.

## Why write a data management plan?

In many cases you will write your data management plan because a funding
agency requires it – in the US, for example, the National Science
Foundation (NSF) has required data management plans since 2011.
Different funders have slightly different requirements for DMPs, but the
NSF’s requirement of a 2-page document is fairly typical. An important
goal of your data management plan, then, is to convey to the funder that
you have thought carefully about data management.

We would encourage you, though, to compose a data management plan even if you are not required to do so by a funder.  Having your plans for your data written out helps keep you organized and on track as you conduct your research project. Having written plans can be especially useful if you need to coordinate the activities of a research team – including just a couple of RAs. Having your data management plans written out also allows you to communicate those plans to others. At QDR, for example, looking at researchers' DMPs allows us to quickly understand their goals and needs, helping us to offer them the support they need.

**From the field:** The NSF and other agencies are starting to look at
data management plans more and more closely. In 2012, barely adequate
DMPs were routinely accepted. That is no longer the case. Take the DMP
portion of your grant seriously.

## Tools for writing a data management plan

You can find a lot of resources for writing data management plans and we
have listed some at the end of this lesson. Here we would like you to
take a close look at two resources.

At QDR, we have provided a [*data management
checklist*](https://qdr.syr.edu/drupal_data/public/QDR%20-%20Data%20Management%20Checklist.pdf),
specifically designed for qualitative researchers to make sure their
data management plan covers all important topics. For every topic we
provide examples, where possible from qualitative research. We also
include tips based on our work advising researchers on their data
management plans. You can use the checklist both *proactively* as a
guide to writing your DMP or, as the name implies, to check that an
existing data management plan covers everything it should.

Still, you may find it difficult to start writing such a plan. A useful
tool for this it the [*DMP Tool*](https://dmptool.org/), produced by the
California Digital Library. The DMP Tool provides a large number of
templates, based on funder requirements, and helps you to structure your
DMP according to those templates, guiding you through the process with
questions. When you are done, it provides you with a neatly formatted
data management plan. The language of the DMP Tool can be a bit
abstract, so it may be useful to combine it with QDR’s checklist.

## Some Key Elements of a DMP

You should rely on tools such as our checklist or the DMP Tool for a
comprehensive list. Instead of replicating the list here, we’d like to
point to some particularly important or misunderstood issues here.

-   **Personnel:** as a young researcher, you may not think of yourself
    as leading a “team,” but chances are you will be using research
    assistance and potentially other contractors like transcribers,
    translators, or even stringers before you publish your research. You
    should consider what parts of your data these team members can
    access, how you provide (and restrict) access for them, and how you
    will train them to manage your data responsibly.
-   **Data types:** generally, storing your data in standard file
    formats is ideal. Where you rely on proprietary, specialized
    formats, you are at the mercy of the company supporting
    these formats. Using proprietary formats is not always avoidable
    (e.g., most qualitative data analysis software like NVivo or
    atlas.ti stores data in a proprietary format), but do not rely on
    them unnecessarily. Moreover, consider including alternative storage
    and dissemination formats for such data.
-   **Data volume:** DMP guidelines often ask you to specify the volume
    of data. Do not feel like you need to be overly precise here. The
    purpose of this is for you to think of adequate storage facilities,
    so the important thing is to be in the right ballpark: you want to
    know if you need to store 1GB or 1TB of data. It doesn’t matter
    whether it’s 1GB or 2GB.
-   **Metadata:** We will talk more about metadata in module 2, but a
    useful way to address questions about metadata is to talk to the
    repository you want to use to share your data. Repositories commonly
    follow metadata standards and can tell you what those are.
-   **Data sharing:** Even if you can absolutely not share your data
    (e.g., you interviewed people acutely at risk should the interviews
    become public), you should specify the rationale clearly and
    specifically in your DMP. Funders want to know that you are not just
    defaulting to not-sharing any data.

## Assessing DMPs

How do you know that your DMP is good enough? When working with
researchers, we have often found that assessing *other* researchers DMPs
is a good way to think about this. We use a rubric developed by a group
of US librarians to assess DMPs submitted to NSF for their compliance
with NSF criteria for such plans (Whitmire et al., 2015).

## DMPs as Living Documents

Your data management plan should, ideally, anticipate eventualities, but
let’s be honest: none of us can predict all the eventualities of a
multi-year research project. This is why there is a movement to treat
DMPs as “living documents.” The idea here is that a DMP evolves together
with your project. For example, as you add team members or collect
additional data, this will be added to the DMP. You should either save a
new, date-stamped copy every time you change your DMP or use a version
control system such as git. Used this way, data management plans become
a valuable piece of documentation for your project and also a crucial
point of reference for you. Especially as you are engaging in complex
research projects, we strongly recommend you to consider this approach.

Looking ahead, information specialists are working not just on making
data management plans *living* but also *active*. For example, if you
mention a data repository as part of your planning, the repository would
automatically be notified of this. The data management plan would also
send you automated reminders on key dates specified in the plan. Lastly,
active DMPs would also let funders check easily that you have complied
with the promises made in your DMP (and thus your grant application).

(2017).
