## The Research Data Lifecycle

The “research data lifecycle” has become a ubiquitous image among data
professional. Here is one example:

Based on: Green, Ann G., and Myron P. Gutmann. (2007) “Building
Partnerships among Social Science Researchers, Institution-based
Repositories, and Domain Specific Data Archives.” *OCLC Systems and
Services: International Digital Library Perspectives*. 23: 35-53.

As you think through the organization and management of your research
data, keep this cycle in mind (or even in front of you physically in
front of you: here is as pdf version to print out). Let’s begin with
some questions about the data lifecycle.

## Data Lifeycle and Research Lifecycle

 We introduce the concept of a research project lifecycle (from project design to funding application to research to publication) and the attendant research data lifecycle. This data lifecycle, we demonstrate, tracks the research project lifecycle and also extends beyond the publications of articles or books to ensure the independent existence, accessibility, discoverability and longevity of all of the data generated in association with a research project. Finally, we consider the various benefits of effective data management – to the researcher personally, to other potential users, and to the broader social science community.

## This Course and the Data Lifecycle

This course follows your data around its lifecycle. The following three
lessons focus on the crucial **planning stage**: you will learn the
basics of data management, how to write an effective data management
plan, and how to craft a consent script for human participant research
that will later allow you to share your data. The next three modules
focus on managing your data while you are **collecting** them. You will
learn how to document your data so that they are easy to use in the
future. You will learn practical strategies for organizing your data and
files, including naming conventions and back-up strategies. Finally, you
will learn how to transform the raw data you collect effectively, e.g.,
how to digitize documents or transcribe interviews. The following two
lessons address **sharing** your data in a way that’s safe and
responsible. The final three lessons are about **writing and
publishing** with qualitative data.
