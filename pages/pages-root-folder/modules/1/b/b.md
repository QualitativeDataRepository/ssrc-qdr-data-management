learningobjectives:
-   What data management is and why you should do it, and do it well
-   The importance of planning for successful data management
-   How to use the data lifecycle to begin planning for data management
initialquestions:
-   Did you hear about data management before this course? In what
    context?
-   As you engaged in some standard data management practices --
    backing-up, naming and organizing files -- when did you decide on
    the details for them?

## Defining Data Management

This entire course is about data management, so we should probably begin
by *defining* it. One definition we like is by the University of
Edinburgh Research Data Services:

>Research data management is caring for, facilitating access to,
>preserving and adding value to research data throughout its lifecycle.

This definition highlights various features of data management.

-   *Caring for* emphasizes that your data will suffer if you do not
    manage them well. You may lose it entirely, it may become unusable, or
    you may need to spend a lot of time understanding it.
-   *Facilitating access* does refer to the eventual sharing of your
    research data with other researchers, but also applies during your
    research: you want to make sure that the right people (e.g.,
    research assistants, co-authors, dissertation advisors, etc.) can
    access your data while preventing any unauthorized access.
-   *Preserving* your research data means keeping it usable for the long
    term, many years after you collect it.
-   *Adding value* refers to the various activities that make your data
    more valuable: clear structure, thorough documentation, easy
    findability for other researchers.

## Why Data Management
Data management is at the core of good empirical work. You may already
be doing some of the things we cover in this course, whether you think
of them as data management or not. Why should you care about managing
your data well, though?

You should manage your data well because

-   they are valuable. You spend a lot of time and money to generate
    your data and you want to make sure to not lose them and to organize
    them in a way that allows you to quickly find what you’re
    looking for.
-   they are the basis for your empirical claims. Better data management
    ultimately means better research. Additionally, it can help you to
    effectively address any concerns with your data that reviewers or
    critics bring up.
-   others may require it. If you ever apply for an NSF grant, for
    example, you will have to create a data management plan (DMP).
-   your future self will thank you. Research projects take many years
    to complete. By organizing and documenting your data systematically
    throughout, you will still be able to understand it years along.

## Why Data Management *Planning?*
But why this emphasis on planning? There are two main reasons:

-   Steps you take early in your research can have significant impacts
    on what you may be able to do at later stages. For example, whether
    and how you can share your data will depend on the consent language
    you used, which you likely determined early on, in your
    IRB application.
-   Research, particularly fieldwork in a foreign country, is hectic,
    often like juggling many things at once. Some things may be much
    harder or even impossible to set up once you’re away from your
    home base. Having a plan in place for the things that you can plan
    (and for some eventualities) will help you stay organized.

## How Do I Start?
A good way to think about data management is to ask yourself the
following question:

“How can I demonstrate that I have carefully thought about what my data
needs will be at each stage of my research and data lifecycles and that
I have adopted specific and well justified procedures to meet those
needs?”

So let’s start with the data lifecycle that you encountered
in the last lesson.
