## Informed Consent Basics

Informed consent is at the heart of ethical research with human
participants. Whenever your research involves human participants, you
need to make sure they *consent* to being part of your research, and
they fully understand, are *informed *about, what this participation
entails. This is an ethical requirement for social science researchers.
In the US, it is also a legal requirement, mandated by guidelines from
the federal government. This course does not replace a course about
ethical research practices. In the US, you will typically be required to
take such a course prior to conducting research with human participants.
Our focus in this lesson is on developing and using an informed consent script that does not unnecessarily prevent you from sharing data.
In the process, we hope to also provide you with some suggestions on effectively gaining
consent.

A typical informed consent script includes four main elements

1.  Basic information about the study you are conducting
2.  Any risks and benefits associated with participating in the study
3.  Information about you, the researcher, as well as your institution,
    with contact information for both
4.  What participating in the study entails

Commonly, 1-3 are included on a separate *study information sheet*, that
participants can take home.

## Informed Consent in Qualitative Research

Qualitative research sometimes has an uneasy relationship with informed
consent procedures derived from laboratory research, mainly in the
medical sciences. One of the advantages of qualitative research is that
it often takes place in a setting close to participants’ everyday life.
Introducing a legal document to sign in such a context can significantly
disrupt your research. But precisely because qualitative research may
not seem like research to your participants, informed consent is
particularly important.

One way to make the consent process more natural is oral consent:
instead of having participants sign a sheet, you verbally run through a
script and ask participants to agree with it. One disadvantage of oral
consent can be that it leaves you without proof of consent. Where you
record interviews, it is common to restate consent in a highly
abbreviated form at the beginning of the recording.

> ## Tip from the field 
>While oral consent is often more appropriate for
>qualitative research, don’t assume it is. We’ve heard from a scholar who
>found that her interviewees (ex-combatants) were reassured by the
>legitimacy indicated by the written consent form and information sheet.
>Ask others who have engaged in a similar type of research in the context you are studying about their experiences.

Qualitative research also has an advantage over lab-based research in
obtaining truly informed consent. As you build lasting relationships
with participants, you are more likely to be able to communicate to them
what your research is about and what they are participating in.

## Informed Consent and Data Sharing

Traditional informed consent forms will often preclude data sharing.
This happens in the form of two main elements.

1.  Where the informed consent specifically states that only the
    researcher (or the researcher and his team of x collaborators) will
    have access to the data, the data cannot be ethically shared.
2.  Where the informed consent specifies that data will be destroyed
    after a given time, the data cannot be ethically shared.

Such restrictions can be adequate for sensitive, identifiable data, such
as audio-recordings or sensitive interviews. They are almost always in
order for the keys which allow you to re-identify subjects from numbers
or pseudonyms. However, you should, wherever ethically possible, allow
for sharing of de-identified data. You can do so very explicitly.  Consider, for example, this language recently developed by Cornell University's [Institutional Review Board](https://www.irb.cornell.edu/forms/#dThree):

“De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research
community at large to advance science and health. We will remove or code
any personal information that could identify you before files are shared
with other researchers.”

Alternatively, you can mention the possibility of sharing of data in the
context of de-identification, as in this version [*suggested by
ICPSR*](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/deposit/guide/):

“Any personal information that could identify you will be removed or
changed before files are shared with other researchers or results are
made public.”

Do not make any promises that you cannot keep. You should specify that
you will remove identifying information, but you should *not* promise
anonymity to participants, as there are no ways to guarantee that data
are truly anonymous.

## Re-consenting Participants

What can you do if you have already interviewed participants, want to share interview data, but used **consent** language that prevents your from sharing?
Often, the answer to this question is, sadly, nothing. But where you
have good rapport with your participants and you are able to get in
touch with them with relative ease, it is possible to retroactively ask
them to consent to data sharing. Note that your consent form has been
vetted by your IRB, so you must file an amendment to your IRB
application with the updated consent form. Only once it is accepted,
should you re-contact your participants. Keep close notes on who did and
who didn’t agree to the updated script and remember that you can only
share the data of those who did.
